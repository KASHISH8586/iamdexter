         <h1 align="center">HIP-HOP BIO</h1>
        <b><p align="center">Floridian rapper XXXTentacion built his career off of being labeled rap's most controversial man. His short but impressive career is full of headlines highlighting both the greatest and worst moments of his life. His legacy is complicated, with some praising him for the honesty and realness in his songs dealing with his mental health struggles and others denouncing him for his long history of violence. Here is a look back at his entire career, life, and legacy.</p></b><hr>
        <h1 align="center">EARLY LIFE</h1>
        <b><p>XXXTentacion's interest in music initially started after his aunt persuaded him to begin attending school choir and later church choir, however he was soon kicked out after attacking another student. He was expelled from his middle school after a series of physical altercations. He was then enrolled into Sheridan House Family Ministries by his mom for over six months. He began to listen to nu-metal, hard rock and rap during his time at Sheridan House Family Ministries, which led to him learning how to play the piano and guitar.</p></b><hr>
        <h1 align="center">CAREER</h1>
        <b><p>X’s career as a music artist began in June 2013 after the release of his song "News/Flock". According to interviews, while in juvenile detention for gun possession charges, he met Stokeley Goulbourne, better known as Ski Mask the Slump God. Some sources interviewed for a 2020 biography dispute this narrative, and say that the pair met at high school. X and Ski Mask became good friends and began freestyling.</p></b>
        <b><p>That same year, following his release from a juvenile detention center, he and Ski Mask met up again to commit a string of home invasions. X ended up buying a Blue Snowball microphone and began recording music, which convinced Ski to do the same. After X adopted the moniker XXXTentacion, he uploaded his first official song, called "Vice City", on SoundCloud. The word "tentación" in his stage name is the Spanish word for "temptation". Speaking on his decision to abandon a life of crime for music, X said that he felt like music was a better outlet for his feelings and then-girlfriend Geneva Ayala was someone who helped him realize that. X eventually joined Ski Mask the Slump God's group Very Rare, before breaking off and starting the Members Only collective, which Ski Mask then also joined</p></b>
        <b><p>On June 22, 2015, X began to use his long-time YouTube channel "xxxtentacion", previously used to upload music, to upload gaming videos and vlogs. The channel has 32.6 million subscribers and 8.3 billion total views as of June 2021.</p></b><hr>
